             <h3>Introduction</h3>
             <p>Our Hour of Code event was held in EduGrata education center Nasimi branch. Our goal was to introduce different grades(5th,6th,10th) students from neighborhood and 10 students from the course to fundamental concepts of Computer Science. </p>

             <h3>Progress of the event</h3>
             <p>The event was first experience for them with coding, since most of them were young, they did not have a chance to experience coding and algorithms. Some of them from higher grades mentioned that they were familiar with the concept of algorithms. Before moving to the main part of the event, we gave some information about ADA university. In the main part, we explained fundamentals of algorithms and introduced basic concepts to the children. After the exploration period, they began to write simple block codes in Code.org. They expressed that the course was extraordinary and interesting for them.  Some mentioned that course's format, which is like a game, grabbed their attention more and made learning process more enjoyable and fun. They participated actively, some of them even completed all the levels early, while other had trouble and got stuck but all in all, everyone completed the course successfully.  </p>

             <h3>Conclusion and Thanks</h3>
             <p>Despite all difficluties our Hour of Code event finished successfully. We congratulated the children with the special Hour of Code certificates and took collective group picture. As a team, we would like to thank the course administrators and teachers for their great supports. They provided important equipments for our event. Moreover, they assisted us by saving a suitable room for our session, allowing neighborhood children to come to the classroom, sending their own 10 students to participate in the event and permitting us to take the time of one of their classes, allowing to record videos and photos.</p>
